Lol I gave up License

Copyright (C) 2016 Toldierone <toldierone@protonmail.com> 

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 

Preamble
This (ReClop) is small project, for a small audience, so slapping a little bit more
restrictive license than AGPL will do little harm. Also I didn't feel like
pasting the license notice to every file that's part of the project (ReClop).
I am aware that it is (A)GPL incompatible.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. Definitions

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, 
such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. 
Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
"Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work 
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. 
The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work 
"based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, 
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable 
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. 
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), 
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties 
to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, 
with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. 
"Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, 
other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form 
of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, 
and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, 
or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available 
to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, 
means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of 
the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, 
or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed 
to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, 
including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's 
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs 
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. 
For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with 
source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked 
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, 
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms 
and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate 
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, 
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute 
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified 
version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that 
the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or 
interfered with solely because modification has been made.

2. Permissions/Rights
As long as you comply with all Conditions in section 3., you may:
	- Run the program as you wish
	- Study the program inner-workings, and make modifications to it
	- Redistribute exact copies of the program
	- Distribute copies of your modified version to others

3. Conditions
You must:
	- Preserve this license notice verbatim
	- Keep intact all notices stating that this License apply to the code
	- Keep intact all notices of absence of any warranty
	- Give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program
	- Notify the developer <toldierone@protonmail.com> about deployment of the given program
	version licensed under this license 
	(email to <toldierone@protonmail.com> in which you must provide the URL of the server that
	licensed program is intended to run on, and the version (SHA1 of the commit of the used version) 
	of the program that you intend to run)
	(Only 1 time per licensee is required)
	- Provide the source code and installation information of the program 
	running on network server to any user of the program
	(Either along with the distributed product, or by providing clearly-visible 
	and easily-accessible link to download the copy of the source code, free of charge.
	You are obliged to provide the source code as long as you are making 
	the object code available to the public)

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, 
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented 
(and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), 
and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

You must not:
	- Convey the program for a fee or require any kind of charge for conveying or use
	- Use the program for commercial purposes
	- Require any charge or fee for downloading the source code of the program
	- Require any charge or fee for providing the installation information to the user

4. Distribution of modified versions of the program
You may convey a work based on the program, or the modifications to produce it from the program
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
	- The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date
	- The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License.
	This requirement modifies the requirement in section 3 to "keep intact all notices"
	- You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License 
	to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. 
	This License will therefore apply, to the whole of the work, 
	and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. 
	This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, 
	but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

5. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. 
Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer 
transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. 
However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify 
any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. 
Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance 
of this License to do so.

6. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license 
from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.

7. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program 
or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's 
"contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by 
the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by 
some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, 
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further 
modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" 
includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements 
of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under 
the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and 
otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, 
however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent 
or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party 
means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, 
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, 
free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network 
server or other readily accessible means, then you must either: 
	- Cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or 
	- Arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for 
	this particular work, or 
	- Arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, 
	to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. 
	"Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, 
	but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, 
	or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe 
	one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to 
	believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, 
or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license 
to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, 
modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant 
is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, 
prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights 
that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you 
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing 
software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your 
activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the 
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license 
	- In connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you 
	(or copies made from those copies), or 
	- Primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain 
	the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or 
	that patent license was granted, prior to 23 May 2016.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license 
or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under 
applicable patent law.

8. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) 
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, 
then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. 
For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further 
conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both 
those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

9. Remote Network Interaction

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, 
your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely 
through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity 
to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the 
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or 
customary means of facilitating copying of software.

10. Disclaimers
a) Disclaimer of Warranty
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM 
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

b) Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, 
OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE 
TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS 
OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR 
A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR 
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

(Citation from website)
"Can I modify the GPL and make a modified license? (#ModifyGPL)
It is possible to make modified versions of the GPL, but it tends to have practical consequences.

You can legally use the GPL terms (possibly modified) in another license provided 
that you call your license by another name and do not include the GPL preamble, 
and provided you modify the instructions-for-use at the end enough to make it clearly 
different in wording and not mention GNU 
(though the actual procedure you describe may be similar)."
